# Project Euler 046 - Goldbach's Other Conjecture

It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

9 = 7 + 2 x 1<sup>2</sup>

15 = 7 + 2 x 2<sup>2</sup>

21 = 3 + 2 x 3<sup>2</sup>

25 = 7 + 2 x 3<sup>2</sup>

27 = 19 + 2 x 2<sup>2</sup>

33 = 31 + 2 x 1<sup>2</sup>

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

Find the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.
